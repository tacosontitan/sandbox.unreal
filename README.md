## ðŸ”¢ Guess the Number

This basic game is the very first game added to this repository. When the game loads, a random number between `1` and `100` is chosen and the player must guess the number within 10 tries. There's a lamp in this level that indicates how close the player's current guess is to the target number. It does this by using a blue color to represent "cold" guesses and an orange color to represent "hot" guesses.

When the correct number is guessed, the lamp turns green:

Then, the player is given the option to play again or navigate to the main menu.
